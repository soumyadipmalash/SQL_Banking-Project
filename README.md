<!-- I created a Banking daraset with different attributes and can do various operations accordingly. -->

#                                      <!-- Step-01 -->

First I am creating database in name "Banking Project" and there i create TWO Tables
            i. Customer
            ii.[Transaction]
Second I Insert some data on those tables .
Third I Connect "MS SQL" to my vsCode,and connect my databse.

#                                     <!-- Step-02 -->

Then I write 'PYTHON' Code for all the operations accordingly and now to can enter any new user,control the transaction and update all the deposited and withdraw value accordingly.

I can do many operations and that will be updated and store in my database.
